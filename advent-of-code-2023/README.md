# Advent of Code 2023

> [!NOTE]
> This year I've decided to try out [Amper] â€” the declarative build configuration tool introduced by JetBrains.
> Initial configs are taken from [kotlin-hands-on/advent-of-code-kotlin-template-amper][amper-template].
> Also I give the second chance to Fleet as a main IDE.
