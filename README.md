# osipxd's Advent of Code solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code[^aoc] repository.
Here I'm trying to save Xmas every year, mainly using Kotlin but sometimes with other programming languages.

Each year's puzzles are placed in separated directory:

- [2024](advent-of-code-2024/README.md)
- [2023](advent-of-code-2023/README.md)
- [2022](advent-of-code-2022/README.md)

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
